# Project Title

THis program was used and made on the algorithmic trading site quantopian and utilizes its available tools. No output is shown as it is not possible to show the data in jupyter, since it is ran in quantopia using their tools.

The algorithm uses 50 and 200 day movingg averages on the AAPL and AMZN stocks. Those along with the last 10 days of prices are used as features for the program. Random Foreest, Linear SVC, NUSVC and Logisc Regression classifiers were also used. The use of leverage is also implemented in the algorithm.
