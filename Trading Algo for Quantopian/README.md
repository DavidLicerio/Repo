# Trading Algorithm

This program was used and made on the algorithmic trading site quantopian and utilizes its available tools. No output is shown as it is not possible to show the data in jupyter, since it is ran in quantopia using their tools.

The trading algorithm first gathers the financial data using the stock symbols. Next a function is made to get the stock prices and moving averages. A while loop is added to create the features of the moving averages. This is followed by and if and statement in order to normalize the data. Next, 4 classifiers including RandomForest, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine and Nu SVC. Next, , using the features created, the data is fit and then the prediction is made for the trade. Finally and If, else statement is made in order to tell the algorithm when to buy and when to sell according to the moving averages and the predictions. A record of leverage is also utilized to view more fiscally aggressive avenues.
